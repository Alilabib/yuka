* Base class for fuzzy sets. This type of sets are defined by a membership function

* a gradual transition from regions completely outside the set to regions completely
* within the set, thereby enabling a value to have partial membership to a set.
*
* This class is derived from {@link FuzzyTerm} so it can be directly used in fuzzy rules.
* According to the composite design pattern, a fuzzy set can be considered as an atomic fuzzy term.
